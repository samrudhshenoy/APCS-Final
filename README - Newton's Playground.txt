Our program is a visual physics simulator, specifically designed for building and running user-built kinematic ball and obstacle configurations. Our program is very
customizable, letting the user set their personal preference for aspects such as downward gravitational acceleration, ground friction, and ball weight.


The overall goal of the program is to allow the user to test various and infinitely many scenarios to experiment with how the physics in our world affect the way that
objects move. The program can be used in both a scientific setting, as well as simply for entertainment. Due to the inability or inconvenience to change certain real-life 
variables (gravity, friction, a singular object's mass, etc.), our program aims to allow users to
have the power to do so at their fingertips.


One of our main inspirations motivating the creation of Newton's Playground is our knowledge of Physics. We both have knowledge in Physics A and B, and wanted to create
an application at the crossroads of Computer Science as well as another science. Additionally, during class, our physics teacher often mentions that she wishes we could 
take our experiments farther, but that our limitations to alter physical qualities stand in the way. Through this online program, students can conduct such experiments 
in the manner preferred, including our physics teacher who we hope to show this program to.


Regarding usability, our designated target market are those who are involved in physics, so curious students or physics departments at schools could use the program provide
an easy to comprehend visualization of common word problems students tend to have trouble on, or to explain the meanings behind formulas.

Feedback


* Move “Different objects” to Want to Have
* Perhaps use different materials
   * Such as a rubber ball or metal ball
* Change the readme to flow better and “sell” your program


UML
* Add depends on relationships
* Nothing is going into ball, ramp, wall, and platform
